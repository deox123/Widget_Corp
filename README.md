CMS based on Lynda PHP with MySQL essential training

Features: 
- public and admin area; 
- dynamic content (subjects and pages); 
- adding/deleting admins; 
- dynamic navigation; 
- hiding content from the public view; 
- user authentication; password hashing; 
- regulating page access; 
- storing error messages in session. 
- fully responsive (bootstrap and flexbox). 

My next goal is to implement ajax and to add some other featuers such as likes and comments.
